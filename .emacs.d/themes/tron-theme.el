;; All patches welcome

;; --------------
;; This porting makes tron no longer rely on color-theme package, 
;; since Emacs has it's theme mechanism from Emacs 24.

;; How to use:
;; copy the theme file to your themes folder or create one in your home directory.
;; edit init.el and add this 2 lines: 
;;(add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/")
;;(load-theme `tron t)
;;
;; or
;; load it manually by pressing
;; M-x load-theme, then choose tron, it should work
;; Or, simple use (load-theme 'tron t) to enable the theme from start.
